## 🧠 3. Code Concepts Used

This project demonstrates key beginner Python concepts:

- `input()` — to collect user information and queries  
- `if/elif/else` — for decision-making based on what the user says  
- `print()` formatting — for readable and friendly output  
- `while True:` — to keep the chatbot running in a loop  
- `lists` and `dictionaries` — to store country data  
- `requests` — to fetch live data from external APIs

## 🛠️ 4. Why It’s Useful

LITT-UP shows how Python can be used to:

- Simulate real-world conversation with emotion and logic
- Teach beginners how to combine **data, logic, and user input**
- Provide **interactive and practical learning** of Python
- Model how AI should be: **intelligent, human-like, and supportive**
